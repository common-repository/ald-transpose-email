Keeps your email safe from spammers when you want to use mailto: links.

== Description ==

Putting your email address in a blog post is an open invitation to spammers. There are several methods to prevent this, like using a contact form or obfuscating your email. 

<a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/transpose-email-plugin/">Transpose Email plugin</a> allows you to use JavaScript to create an encoded link. Clicking that link will trigger the user's email client to open and create an email.

You have the option to set the default subject line to whatever you want.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip ald-transpose-email.zip as is into your plugins folder, usually `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin on the plugin screen
3. Add <a href="javascript:Transpose_Email('user','example.com','About your site') ">Email Me</a>. Change user and domain.com to match your email address.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements for this plugin? =

1. WordPress 1.5 or above 
2. The user's browser needs to have JavaScript enabled

= Can I customize what is displayed? =

Yes, you can. The javascript function accepts the following arguments:
1. userid - The part that comes before the @ in your email address e.g. if your email address is <code>user@example.com</code>, enter it as <code>user</code>
2. domain - The part that comes after the @ in your email address e.g. my email address is <code>user@example.com</code>, enter it as <code>example.com</code>
3. subject - The subject line of the email you will receive.

= Do I really need this plugin? =
This plugin would be useful when you don't want to use your contact form and instead use mailto: links. Using mailto: has the drawback of spambots finding your email address. This plugin encrypts your emailaddress, thus keeping you safe from spammers.
